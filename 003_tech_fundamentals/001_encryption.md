| ----------------------------------       | ------------------------------ |
| protects from physical theft/tampering.  | protects data transmitted b/t  |
| comp encrypts to storage, decrypts when  | two places.                    |
| reading from storage. if hd taken, data  |                                |

| decrypt, theif gets encrypted data.      |                                |
| EAR is common in cloud. data is stored   |                                |
| on shared hardware & encrypted.          |                                |
| generally used when only one party       |                                |
| involed. only they know the encryption   |                                |
| and key                                  |

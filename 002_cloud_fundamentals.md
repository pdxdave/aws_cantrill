# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

## The parts of cloud computing
1. On-demand self-service. Meaning, can provision capabilities as needed w/o requiring human interaction.
2. Broad network access.  Meaning, capabilities are availble over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms (http, https, ssh, remote desktop).
3. Resource pooling. A sense of location independence. No control or knowledge of the exact location of the resources. Resources are pooled (memory, storage, cpu's) to server multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
4. Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand.  To consumers, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited.
5. Measured service. Resources usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and billed.


## Public vs Private vs Hybrid vs Multi Cloud
1. AWS, Azure and Google all offer private clouds that can be combined with public clouds.

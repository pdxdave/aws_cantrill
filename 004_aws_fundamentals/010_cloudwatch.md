# Cloud Watch
It is a support service used by almost all other AWS services. 

It performs three main jobs:
1. It collects and manages operational data on your behalf.  
2. Any data about an environment by detailing how it performs, how it normally runs.
3. Or any logging data that it generates.

## Three products in one
1. Metrics: it allows the collection of metrics, monitoring of metrics and actions based on metrics
    * Metrics are data simply relating to AWS Products, Apps, and on-premises systems.  For example, CPU uses on EC2 instances, disc space useage for on-premises server, or maybe the number of visiters per second to a website.

# S3 Basics
1. Global storage platform - regional based/resilient     
    * It's a public service that can be accessed anywhere with an internet connection
    * It's region based b/c your data is stored in a specific AWS region.
    * It never leaves that region unless you specifically set it up to do so.
    * It's regionally resilient b/c the data is replicated across that region.
2. It's a public service, unlimitted data & multi-user (in the millions) can access it
3. It's perfect for hosting large amounts of data (e.g., movies, audio, photos, lrg data sets, etc)
4. Economical & accessed via UI/CLI/API/HTTP
5. It should be the default starting point for storing data
6. S3 has two main things it delivers: Objects & Buckets
    * Objects: pictures, movies, large stores of data sets
    * Buckets: containers for objects

## Objects

# Virtual Private Cloud basics
This is a private service for which other private services will run from.   

VPC's are also the service which is used to connect your AWS private networks to your on-premises network when creating a hybrid environment, or it's the service which lets you connect to other cloud platforms when you're creating a multi-cloud deployment.

 * VPC's are Region Resilient (defined in 002 notes)
 * Default VPC has a max of one per region.
    1. Initially created by AWS
    2. Come preconfigured in a very specific way
    3. Less flexible than custom VPCs
 * Custom VPCs can have many in a region.
    1. Configure anyway you want as long as in the rules and limits of VPCs
    2. Require you to customize everything from end-to-end and are 100% private by default
    3. Used in almost all serious AWS deployments
    4. They can be linked with other VPCs and configured to communicate with other cloud platforms and on-premises networks

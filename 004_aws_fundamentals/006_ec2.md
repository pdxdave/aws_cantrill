# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
This is pretty much the default compute system within AWS. 

## What is it?
1. EC2 provides access to VMs known as instances
2. If you need to deploy any kind of compute that needs an operating system, run time environment, database dependencies, applications and application interfaces.  EC2 is the service to manage them.

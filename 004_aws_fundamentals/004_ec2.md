# Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
This is pretty much the default compute system within AWS. 

## What is it?
1. EC2 provides access to VMs known as instances
2. If you need to deploy any kind of compute that needs an operating system, run time environment, database dependencies, applications and application interfaces.  EC2 is the service to manage them.

## Important features
1. It is IaaS => Infrastructure as a Service.  It provides access to EC2 machines known as virtual instances.
2. Your unit of consumption is the instance.  An instance is just an OS configured in a certain way with a certain set of allocated resources. 
3. It's a private AWS services.  It runs in the private AWS zone.  An EC2 instance is configured to launch into a single VPC subnet.  
4. Public access has to be configured if you want it.  If so, the VPC that it is in needs to support public access.  A default VPC provides an IPv4 public address.  Custom VPC's don't.  You have to set it up.
5. EC2 is AZ Resilient. This is because an instance is launched into a specific subnet and because a subnet is in a specific AZ. If the AZ fails, the instance fails. 
6. When you launch an instance you can choose from different sizes and capabilities.  These can be changed after launch.
7. EC2 offers on-demand billing.  It's either by the second or the hour depending on the software that is launched with the instance.
8. There is the charge for running the instance (cpu, memory), the storage, and extras for commercial software.
9. Two popular types of storage
    * Local host storage that EC2 instance runs on
    * Elastic block store. This is network storage made available to the instance. 
10. Instances lifecycle and billing

* When the instance is terminated, everything is gone from storage.

## Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
1. An AMI can be used to create an EC2 instance, or an EC2 instance can create an AMI
2. An AMI is similar to a server image used to create virtual machines, or a USB device used to install Windows, Linux, etc.
3. An AMI contains
    * Attached permissions for which accounts can and can't control the AMI
        1. Can be set to Public - everyone is allowed
        2. Owner of AMI - implicit allowed
        3. Explicit - the owner grants permissions to specific AWS accounts
    * Root Volume of instance - C drive in Windows or Root volume in Linux
    * Block device mapping - A configuration which links the volumes the AMI has and how they're presented to the OS. It determines which volume is the boot volume, the data volume

## Connecting to EC2
1. They can run a distro or version of Linux, or a version of Windows
2. You connect to Windows instances using RDP.  Linux use SSH protocol.

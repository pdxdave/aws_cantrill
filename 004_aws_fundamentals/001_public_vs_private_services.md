# Public Vs Private
1. AWS services can be categorized between two main types: public and private.
2. Private and Public services refer only to networking.
    * A public AWS service is accessed using public end-points such as S3. S3 can be accessed anywhere that has an Internet connection.
    * A private AWS service is something that runs within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). So only things w/in that VPC or what is connected to that VPC can access the service.
    * For both of these there are permissions as well as networking.
